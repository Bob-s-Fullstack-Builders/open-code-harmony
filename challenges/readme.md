# Challenges!

Or maybe we should call them tasks or something silly and positive...Tinas, I dunno.

Eventually these would go into a DB probably, but for now experimenting with making a directory with three files in it:

- description.md - The challenge description
- prompt.js - The starter function name with empty code braces
- test.js - The Mocha test(s)

This is just a starting idea.

## To Do

Deploy and test this against a user-submitted solution
