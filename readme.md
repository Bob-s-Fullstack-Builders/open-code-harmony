## What's in *that* folder?

- api-server - A node express app that will handle code submissions; see [#4](https://github.com/Bob-s-Fullstack-Builders/open-code-harmony/issues/4)
- api-server/frontend - The static client code to go on <https://www.opencodeharmony.com/>; see [#3](https://github.com/Bob-s-Fullstack-Builders/open-code-harmony/issues/3)
- challenges - For now, a folder of folders, each one containing 3 files defining a challenge
