# Open Code Harmony

An early prototype JavaScript code challenge engine using Mocha and node's assert module.
Everything will radically change.

## What's in *that* folder?

- api-submission - A node express app that will handle code submissions; see [#4](https://github.com/Bob-s-Fullstack-Builders/open-code-harmony/issues/4)
- challenges - For now, a folder of folders, each one containing 3 files defining a challenge
- frontend - The static client code to go on <https://www.opencodeharmony.com/>; see [#3](https://github.com/Bob-s-Fullstack-Builders/open-code-harmony/issues/3)
- prototype - The very beginning of the project just testing Mocha; probably to be deleted
